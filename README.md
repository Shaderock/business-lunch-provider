<h1>Business Lunch Provider</h1>
A multiplatform web and mobile application that allows businesses to easily order lunches from multiple suppliers that 
have their own delivery system with customizable order options and preferences.

<h2>Why Business Lunch Provider?</h2>
Nowadays exist businesses that would like to order business lunches for all their employees. This would require them to
have a responsible person who would collect all the orders, validate them, call or send suppliers orders in their own
format, notify colleagues about any changes, etc. It sometimes happens that employees want to try something new and
apparently change the supplier but this would lead for a too long negotiation process.

I have personally experienced this situation and would like to make an attempt to improve the situation. I am inspired 
to create a service where businesses can streamline the ordering process and allow their employees to browse and select 
from a variety of suppliers. This not only saves time and effort for the company, but also gives suppliers the 
opportunity to reach a larger audience and streamline the negotiation process with potential customers.
