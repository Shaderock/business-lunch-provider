# Business Lunch Provider
## The Idea
A multiplatform web and mobile application that allows businesses to easily order lunches from multiple suppliers that 
have their own delivery system with customizable order options and preferences.

## The Problem
Nowadays exist businesses that would like to order business lunches for all their employees. This would require them to
have a responsible person who would collect all the orders, validate them, call or send suppliers orders in their own
format, notify colleagues about any changes, etc. It sometimes happens that employees want to try something new and
apparently change the supplier but this would lead for a too long negotiation process.

## Scope
The scope of this project is to go through multiple product development stages in order to create a final web, mobile and IoT application according to the idea that would boost my skills as a developer in a relatively short period of time.

## Customer
Business lunch delivery companies (suppliers) and companies that order business lunches authorize payment for the project.
The app will benefit both suppliers and companies by providing a convenient and efficient interface for ordering business lunches, saving companies time and effort (by not spending time collecting and validating all the orders from their employees every day) and offering suppliers an advertising opportunity to reach a wider audience of potential customers.

## Why Business Lunch Provider?
I have personally experienced this situation and would like to make an attempt to improve the situation and boost my developing skills by that. I am inspired 
to create a service where businesses can streamline the ordering process and allow their employees to browse and select 
from a variety of suppliers. This not only saves time and effort for the company, but also gives suppliers the 
opportunity to reach a larger audience and streamline the negotiation process with potential customers.
